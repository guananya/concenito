1. Click on the green "Code" button on the top right corner of this page.
2. Click "Download ZIP" 
3. Click on the zip file to unzip it

## Running the app:
1. Go to your finder and find the unzipped folder containing the code
2. Click on that folder with two fingers and then click the key, "option" on your keyboard (on the bottom left side)
3. Once you do that, you should see "Copy ____ as pathname". Click on that.
4. Then, open your terminal (if you just look up the app, you'll be able to find it!)
5. Type: "cd " and paste the pathname you had copied in step 3.

Made with webaudiorecorder.js and Google's Speech Recognition.

After contemplating building my own model, I realised Google's Speech Recognition would be optimal since it works well even with significant background sound such as that of a piano playing!
